This is the 0.7 rewrite of Freenet. This is largely rewritten from scratch, 
although it pulls in a load of code from Dijjer.

Major changes:
- Freenet now uses UDP
- Freenet now uses 32kB fixed block sizes
- Many more...

Freenet is under the GPLv2 - see LICENSE.Freenet. However, we use some other 
code:
- Mantissa is under the modified BSD license. See README.Mantissa. According 
  to the FSF, modified BSD is compatible with GPL; we must include both 
  licenses.
