- update certificate
- update freenet-install.jar

- files to be potentially updated:
	jar/*.jar
	bin/wrapper-etc (platform dependent)
	lib/wrapper-etc (platform dependent)

- update strategy:
	- pick a source, either HTTPS or freenet itself
	- download SHA1SUMS
	- compare with existing files
	- if any need to be updated, download them to tmp/get/
	- if node is up, shut it down
	- update files
	- restart node
